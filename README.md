# AUTHENTICATION 

This project is a basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)



### MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. Create an account on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Create a new cluster and configure your database settings.
3. Obtain the connection string from your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

### Configuring MongoDB Connection

Replace the placeholder MongoDB connection string in your server code with the connection string obtained from MongoDB Atlas. Look for the MongoDB connection configuration in your server code (typically in `server.js` or similar) and update it.


### Installing Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies for both the server and client:

```bash


# Move to the client directory
cd server

# Install server dependencies
npm install

# Move to the client directory
cd client

# Install client dependencies
npm install
